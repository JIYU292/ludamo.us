            <h2 class="section-title">Core Concepts: Hardware & Software</h2>
            <p>A computer system consists of two fundamental parts that work together. Neither can function without the other.</p>
            <h3>Hardware</h3>
            <p>Hardware refers to all the physical components of a computer that you can see and touch. It's the "body" of the computer. Examples include the monitor, keyboard, mouse, and the various parts inside the computer case.</p>
            <h3>Software</h3>
            <p>Software is a series of programs and instructions installed on the hardware that tells the hardware what to do. It's the "soul" of the computer. Examples include the browser you are using, your operating system (Windows/macOS), and various applications.</p>

            <div class="hardware-grid">
                <div class="hardware-card">
                    <h3>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h3>
                    <p>The CPU is the "brain" of the computer, responsible for processing all calculations and instructions. Its speed directly determines the computer's performance.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="hardware-card">
                    <h3>Memory (RAM)</h3>
                    <p>RAM (Random Access Memory) is "temporary storage" used to hold data that the CPU is actively processing. The more RAM you have, the more programs you can run smoothly at the same time.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="hardware-card">
                    <h3>Hard Drive (HDD/SSD)</h3>
                    <p>The hard drive is "permanent storage" used for long-term saving of your files, photos, and software. SSDs (Solid-State Drives) are much faster than traditional HDDs (Hard Disk Drives).</p>
                </div>
                 <div class="hardware-card">
                    <h3>Graphics Card (GPU)</h3>
                    <p>The GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) specializes in processing and outputting images to your monitor. A good graphics card is essential for gaming, design work, or watching high-definition video.</p>
                </div>
                 <div class="hardware-card">
                    <h3>Motherboard</h3>
                    <p>The motherboard is a large circuit board that acts like a central hub, connecting all the hardware components like the CPU, RAM, and hard drive, allowing them to work together.</p>
                </div>
                 <div class="hardware-card">
                    <h3>Power Supply Unit (PSU)</h3>
                    <p>The PSU is responsible for providing stable and continuous power to all computer components. It is the energy source for the entire system.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Essential Software Knowledge</h2>
            <h3>Operating System (OS)</h3>
            <p>The operating system is the core software that manages all hardware and software. It provides an interface for you to interact with the computer. The most common desktop operating systems are <strong>Windows</strong>, <strong>macOS</strong>, and <strong>Linux</strong>.</p>
            <h3>Application Software</h3>
            <p>Application software consists of programs designed to perform specific tasks. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Browser:</strong> Such as Chrome or Edge, used for accessing the internet.</li>
                <li><strong>Office Suite:</strong> Such as Microsoft Office, used for word processing and spreadsheets.</li>
                <li><strong>Media Player:</strong> Used for playing music and videos.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="section-title">Daily Computer Usage Tips</h2>
            <ul class="tips-list">
                <li>
                    <strong>Learn common keyboard shortcuts:</strong> They can significantly increase your productivity. For example, <code>Ctrl + C</code> (Copy), <code>Ctrl + V</code> (Paste), <code>Ctrl + Z</code> (Undo), and <code>Ctrl + S</code> (Save).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Regularly clean and organize your files:</strong> Tidying up your desktop and folders like you would your room helps you find files faster and keeps your system running smoothly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Protect your eyes:</strong> Every 20-30 minutes, look away from the screen and focus on a distant object to give your eyes a rest.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Regularly update your software and OS:</strong> Updates often include important security patches and performance improvements. Keeping them up-to-date makes your computer safer and more stable.
                </li>
                 <li>
                    <strong>Regularly back up important data:</strong> Nothing is more frustrating than data loss. Use cloud services (like OneDrive, Google Drive) or an external hard drive to back up your important files regularly.
                </li>
            </ul>
